# Bicycle Shop

The Bicycle Shop is a Single Page Application divided into two parts: the Client-Side Interface and the Admin Panel. When a user with the role of administrator or owner logs into the site, an Admin section appears in the navigation panel.

## Features

- **Client-Side Interface**: Product browsing and adding items to the cart are available to all users. To place an order and leave a review on a product, registration is required.
- **Admin Panel**: The admin panel is accessible only to registered users who have been assigned the role of administrator or owner.
- **User Registration**: Visitors can register by providing an email and password or log in using an existing Google account.

## Technologies

- **Angular 15**: For building the frontend application.
- **CRUD Operations**: For managing product data.
- **Firebase**: For backend services and data storage.
- **Bootstrap / ng-bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI components.
